This project investigates the influence of spatial abilities on the preparation of endodontic access cavities among third-year dental students. It includes Python scripts for automatic detection of access cavities, alignment of scanned tooth models, and evaluation of practical performance based on various parameters. The study aims to enhance the understanding of how spatial abilities affect endodontic procedures and to explore potential curriculum adaptations to improve skill development in dental education.
